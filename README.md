# SmartMirror
A "Smart Mirror" is a two-way mirror with a display behind it that is typically used to display useful information like the time and date, the weather, your calendar, and all sorts of other things! People use them for all kinds of purposes. You'll see them placed in the bathroom, in the kitchen, as a vanity, all over the place!
